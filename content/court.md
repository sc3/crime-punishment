### Summary  
Cook County Circuit Court adjudicates criminal, civil and probate cases. The cases entered in the court system becomes public record. These records are open to anyone who wants to review them. However, the courts are not subject to FOIA. The records are kept by the Cook County Clerk's office. 

The data inventory is a list of the information that's collected by the Cook County Circuit Court for anyone who's charged with a crime. 


### Data Inventory
###### Open Data
Publicly available online there is nothing. Some people, including journalists, who engage in protracted fights with the Circuit Clerk's Office, can obtain data once Chief Judge Evans has approved your request. Our experience lasted 15 months and required a threat to file a lawsuit before they gave us the data we requested. 

###### FOIA Data
The Courts are exempted from the FOIA requirements. It is unclear to what degree the Circuit Clerk's Office, that maintains the Court's data, is open to FOIA and would have to release the Court data.
