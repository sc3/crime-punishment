### Data Inventory
###### Open Data
Court records are considered open upon their creation. The Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County maintains offices in each of the court buildings to guarantee that access to the paper records is reasonably efficient. However, access to digital data maintained by the Clerk’s office is another story all together. You have to file a request for access to this data with Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans. If that request is approved you then have to wait an uncertain amount until the data is made available. You also have to pay what seems to be a random amount of money depending on the type and quantify of the data you requested.  

###### FOIA Data
The Courts are exempted from the FOIA requirements. It is unclear to what degree the Circuit Clerk's Office, that maintains the Court's data, is open to FOIA and would have to release the Court data.
